# cpp-utils

Personal utilities for C++

This project is a kind of shelf providing many functions. With a few clearly indicated exceptions, these functions are self-supporting. They do not require any dependency, or to be built/integrated in any specific way. Because "the truly reusable code is the one that you can simply copy-paste".

A test suite is proposed.

When relevant, functions are illustrated with associated `SHOW_xxx` functions.

File **dates_and_times.cpp**  
   - function `parse_date_time_UTC`  
   - function `format_date_time_UTC`  
   - function `print_date_time_UTC`

File **doubles.cpp**  
   - function `parse_double`

File **durations.cpp**  
   - function `measure_duration`

File **files.cpp**  
   - function `count_lines`
   
File **integer_digits.cpp**  
   - function `reverse_number`
   
File **integer_primes.cpp**  
   - function `largest_prime_factor__long_long`  
   - function `sieve_eratosthenes`
